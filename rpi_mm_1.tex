\section{Introduction}
In this part, you will need to recall some practical skills in {\em computer communication and networks} that you learned in LP1. You will configure a local area network that is shared with your group members. There is something you need to know before you come to the lab.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each group (with 3 or 4 members) will get a switch, and each member in the group will get an Ethernet cable. You will together use the switch and the cables to build a wired private network, connecting the Raspberry Pis of all group members in this lab.
    \item Each group needs to bring at least two Raspberry Pis to the lab, each group may occupy two lab computers during the lab session to finish their task.
    \item If you wish you can replace the Raspberry Pi with your own laptop, but in the lab, you need to build a network for all devices that are involved in the system. Be aware though that your supervisors might not be experts on how to configure your particular system and might perhaps only be able to provide limited help.
    \item You will not be given step-by-step introductions on how to build a network, so if you don't remember anything about computer communication or networks, it is a good idea to brush up you skills by consulting the text book or searching the Internet.
\end{itemize}

\section{Building Your Network}
\subsection{Connecting the Hardware}
Before you start, power on the switch, and connect the Raspberry Pis to the switch. You will build the private network using the Ethernet interfaces, but it is better also to connect the Raspberry Pis to WiFi, so that you have access to the Internet for package updating and upgrading.
\subsection{Configuring the IP addresses}
As you learned in the communication systems course, an IP address consists of two parts, network id and host id. Two hosts in the same network should have identical network id and different host ids.\\

\noindent{\bf Question 1: }\parbox[t]{14cm}{\textcolor{red}{Before you start configuring the IP on your Raspberry Pis, write down the network id you intend to use for your network, as well as the net mask and the IP addresses you will assign to the various Raspberry Pis.}}\\

\noindent{\bf Question 2: }\parbox[t]{14cm}{\textcolor{red}{Write down the name of network interface that you will assign the IP address to.}}

\noindent{Note: }\parbox[t]{14cm}{We do realize that these are not actually questions, but that it is essential to your work.}\\

Now you can assign IP addresses to the Raspberry Pis. There are various ways to assign IP addresses to an interface.
You can either use the command \verb!ip addr add <address/netmask> dev <interface>! or put the address in the network settings of your Raspberry Pis using the GUI (network icon -- advanced options -- edit connections). Make sure that you have the network mask configured correctly and that you assign the IP address \emph{manually} (static IP) and not \emph{automatically} (dynamic IP).

Once you correctly assign the IP addresses, your Raspberry Pis should be able to communicate correctly with each other. Verify using \verb!ping! that you have a working connection between the different Raspberry Pis in your network.

Another useful tool is the command \verb!ip addr! which lists the properties, including ip addresses, of all your interfaces. It can help you determining the names of your interfaces and which IP number, if any, is associated with them.

\section{Deploying the Drone System}
Once you have your network configured successfully, you can deploy the drone system on the Raspberry Pis. Clone the {\color{blue}\href{https://github.com/HaoruiPeng/InfoCom-LP3-Lab1}{GitHub Repository}} \href{https://github.com/HaoruiPeng/InfoCom-LP3-Lab1}{(https://github.com/HaoruiPeng/InfoCom-LP3-Lab1)} to both Raspberry Pis in your network. In this lab we will use one Raspberry Pi to run the servers and another to run the drone simulation (you will thus need a total of two Raspberry Pis for this task). The system architecture is shown in \Cref{fig:sys}.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{architecture.png}
    \caption{System architecture}
    \label{fig:sys}
\end{figure}

The system setup here is different from that in the last part of the LP2 lab. The drone part is now moved to a separate Raspberry Pi (Pi One in \Cref{fig:sys}). Therefore, in order for the route planner to be able to send addresses information to the drone, we need to have the Raspberry Pis communicate via the network through IP addresses. Therefore, the Drone Pi also needs to run a flask server (\verb!drone.py!) in order to listen to requests from the route planner.

Once the Drone Pi receives coordinates, it starts the simulation and updates its location to the Redis database, which is hosted on the Server Pi. Thus, both Pis need to know each other's IP addresses in order to communicate. Open the code files on both Raspberry Pis, replace the {\bf REDIS\_SERVER}\footnote{Also check the connection to the Redis database in \texttt{routeplanner.py}.} and {\bf DRONE\_IP} with the correct addresses on Server Pi, and replace {\bf WEBSERVER\_IP} on the Drone Pi. Then run the system by following the instructions in \verb!README.md!. If everything is configured correctly, you should be able to input addresses in your browser and see the drone moving on the map, as in LP2. When you have finished all the tasks in this part, show the TA your working system.
% {\bf Hint 1: }\parbox[t]{14cm}{Check for updates to this document. Instructions may have been clarified in a more recent version. You can find the version number of the document on the very first page. The version number is the compile-date of the document in ISO-format~\cite{iso-date-time}.}\\
% {\bf Hint 2: }\parbox[t]{14cm}{To avoid rewriting many commands, you can use the keys \texttt{arrow up} and \texttt{arrow down} to go back and forth between the commands that you just wrote.}\\
% {\bf Hint 3: }\parbox[t]{14cm}{To paste commands into the terminal you can use \texttt{Ctrl + Shift + V}}\\
% {\bf Hint 4: }\parbox[t]{14cm}{tab in instructions}\\
% {\bf Hint 5: }\parbox[t]{14cm}{To avoid rewriting many commands, it can be a good idea to write all steps in a batch-file or shell script. Then you can also reuse the batch file for the second project.}
